|Phase|Strength|Weakness|Experience Level|
|-----|--------|--------|----------------|
|Discovery| Identifying problems and clarifying goals| Formulating Objectives – I would say identifying problems and knowing what we want the end results to be is simpler than formulating a working plan| Medium: In my current position I am in control of our Risks Dashboard. I maintain all our program risk’s, we keep score of our risk, our action plans and steps that are being taken to mitigate every program risk. We have bi-weekly risk meetings to update all risk and update our risk status|

|Strategy| Defining the requirements and the actions needed to solve the problem| Steps to executing the plan, whether that’s reviewing research, journey maps, etc.| Low: I have no real experience in this area, strategizing in this format is not something I’m familiar with|

|Information Architecture | Auditing existing content –reviewing and organizing ideas and procedures | Creating prototypes, wireframes, storyboards, along with testing usability | Low: I no exposure to wireframing, prototyping or usability. This phase would be a big learning curve for me |

|Visual Design | Understanding and developing the visual aesthetic, understand visual design and color theory, typography and the list of visual elements that are needed to deploy a solution | constructing deliverable material such as moodboards and mindmaps | Medium: My interest and knowledge in visual design would be my strongpoint out of all the phases. I continue to learn and explore the field |

|Development Phase I I have basic(beginner) HTML/CSS knowledge | I don’t have in-depth coding knowledge, coding a site would really be a challenge | Low: I don’t have a high level knowledge with coding|

|Launch Phase | Documentation – part of my job is maintain reports, files and dashboards, documenting plays a huge part of that | Deploying solutions or projects – I have little to no knowledge on deploying live projects and the deliverables that are involved with the launch phase | Low: Accessibility testing, case study and live project works are a few of the deliverables that I have no familiarity or knowledge of. This will be a learning curve for me|
